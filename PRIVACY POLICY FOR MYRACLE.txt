PRIVACY POLICY FOR MYRACLE.AI ON QUEST 2, QUEST PRO, AND QUEST 3


Myracle.ai is an immersive app developed by Cerebranium Tech Private Limited for the Meta Quest platform. We prioritize your privacy and are committed to complying with all applicable data protection regulations, including the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), India’s data protection laws, and the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), as our app is designed for users of all ages, including children.


Myracle.ai requires an active internet connection and uses secure authentication provided by a trusted cloud service (Firebase by Google). We only collect minimal personal information (email and password) necessary to provide a personalized and secure experience.


COMMITMENT TO CONFIDENTIALITY


Cerebranium Tech Private Limited is committed to safeguarding your privacy while you use Myracle.ai on the Meta Quest platform. Below are the key points of our privacy policy:


Confidential Information


"Confidential Information" refers to any data or information exchanged between Cerebranium Tech Private Limited and the user in any form. While we collect basic credentials (email and password) for login purposes through Firebase, we do not collect unnecessary personal data, nor do we access user content or conversations outside of specific voice interaction features.


Voice Input and AI Processing


Myracle.ai includes a feature that allows users to speak using the microphone (e.g., by pressing the controller) to interact with AI-powered systems.


When this feature is used:
- The voice input is temporarily recorded and transmitted to a secure external AI platform via plugin integration for real-time processing.
- The AI processes the spoken input and returns a voice or text response to the app.
- Voice recordings are not stored by Cerebranium Tech Private Limited or retained after the session ends.
- We do not use these recordings for training purposes, and to our knowledge, neither does our AI provider. However, as the processing occurs on a third-party plugin, their data handling practices may apply.


This feature is used only to generate dynamic in-app responses and is not used for profiling, advertising, or persistent storage.


Ownership and Use of Data


The limited data you provide (email and password) is used exclusively for:
- Account creation
- Login and authentication
- Password recovery
- Securing user access


We do not sell, share, or monetize your data. No third-party providers, aside from Firebase and the temporary AI voice processing system, will have access to your personal information.


Data Transmission


Myracle.ai requires an internet connection to function. Encrypted data is securely transmitted to Firebase servers and, when applicable, to the external AI system for temporary voice processing. No voice or gameplay data is permanently stored. Microphone and spatial data are accessed only during gameplay and are not recorded.


USER RIGHTS & DATA PROTECTION


Users have full control over their accounts. While we currently do not have in-app deletion functionality, users may request deletion of their account and all associated data by contacting our support team at:


support@myracle.io


Requests will be handled promptly. We retain user data only while the account is active.


CHILDREN’S PRIVACY


Myracle.ai is intended for a general audience, including children. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 without verifiable parental consent in compliance with COPPA and other global regulations.


When children use voice-enabled features, the same protections apply:
- Voice data is used only during live sessions and is not stored.
- We do not retain or analyze any voice input beyond what is needed for the real-time interaction.


If you are a parent or guardian and believe we may have collected your child's data without proper consent, please contact us immediately at support@myracle.io and we will take appropriate action.


DURATION OF THE AGREEMENT


This privacy agreement is effective from the moment you download and install Myracle.ai. The terms remain in effect as long as the app is installed or your account is active. You may contact us at any time to request deletion of your account and related data.


GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION


This Privacy Policy is governed by the laws of India. Any disputes arising from or related to this policy will be resolved under Indian jurisdiction. Users outside India may also be protected by applicable local data privacy regulations.


HOW WE PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY


Cerebranium Tech Private Limited ensures that:
- Myracle.ai uses secure Firebase authentication
- Only minimal data (email and password) is collected
- Voice data is processed temporarily and not stored
- No personal or biometric data is retained or analyzed
- Internal access is limited to authorized personnel only


We continually review and update our data protection practices to meet evolving security and regulatory standards.
